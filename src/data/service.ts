        question: "What software do you use for 3D modeling?",
        answer: "We primarily use Blender, Autodesk Maya, and Cinema 4D for high-quality 3D modeling and animation. For motion graphics and compositing, we rely on Adobe After Effects. Depending on the project requirements, we also use ZBrush, Substance Painter, or Unity for real-time previews."
      },
      {
        question: "How long does a typical 3D rendering take?",
        answer: "The rendering time varies depending on scene complexity, resolution, and lighting effects. Simple renders may take 2–6 hours, while detailed, photorealistic renders with reflections, shadows, and ambient lighting can take 24–48 hours per frame. We optimize render times using render farms and efficient lighting setups."
      },
      {
        question: "Can you create animations from 3D models?",
        answer: "Yes, we can animate any 3D model to create engaging walkthroughs, explainer videos, product demonstrations, or architectural flythroughs. Whether you want simple camera pans or complex rigged animations, we offer full 3D animation production from modeling to final video editing."
      },
      {
        question: "Do you provide source files?",
        answer: "Absolutely. We deliver all relevant source files including .blend, .fbx, .obj, .c4d, and associated texture or material files. If animation is involved, we also provide project files and editable sequences for future revisions."
      },
      {
        question: "What information do you need to start a project?",
        answer: "To begin your 3D or animation project, we need clear reference images, product dimensions or architectural plans, material and texture preferences, and any specific requests for lighting, camera angles, animation duration, or output resolution."
